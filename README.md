MostAnagramsFinder is a Java program designed to parse through a dictionary file (in .txt format) and identify the word or words with the most anagrams.
This project includes support for three types of data structures: Binary Search Tree (BST), Red-Black Tree (RBT), and Hash Map.
Command line args: args[0] is the path to the file you wish to parse. args[0] must be a .txt file. 
I've included dictionary.txt and words.txt to use as a demo. 
args[1] is the data structure the user wishes to use to sort and organize the words. 
args[1] must be either string 'rbt' for a red-black tree, 'bst' for a binary search tree, or 'hash' for a hash map.
BSTreeMap, RBTreeMap, and MyHashMap are the custom map implementations. 
MyMap is the generic.
